# throwing_balls
Suppose that you have an N-story building and plenty of balls. Suppose also that a ball is broken if it is thrown off floor F or higher, and unhurt otherwise. First, devise a strategy to determine the value of F.  Is there a way to do it in ~lg N throws ? Is there a way to reduce the cost to ~2lg F?
